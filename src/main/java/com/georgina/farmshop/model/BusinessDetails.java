// Why is this class not an entity?

//The BusinessDetails class is an embedded object within the Seller entity, indicated by the use of @Embedded.
// This means it's meant to be a part of the Seller entity and does not need its own table in the database.
// It represents business-related data (e.g., name, email, logo) that is stored within a seller's profile.
// Since it is embedded within Seller, it doesnâ€™t require a separate table but should be a part of the Seller table.
